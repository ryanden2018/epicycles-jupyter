# epicycles-jupyter
Short Jupyter notebook which draws some epicycles. (M340L-EE instructional material)

This notebook would not have been possible for me without the excellent notes by Nick Charlton, Jake Vanderplas, and Louis Tiao, available through their respective blogs/webpages.

Requires working Jupyter installation, scipy, matplotlib, and crucially, a working ffmpeg installation to run the notebook.

Only tested against Python ver. 3.6.5 via conda.
